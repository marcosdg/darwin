At the moment, darwin does not have a lot of features which makes it simple and
easy to use. The following instructions are the typical end-user use case:

1.  Generally, you would start by generating the input data that will be fed
    into darwin. The input data is just different instances of well-known NP
    problems. Darwin already provides you with some defaults, but you can modify
    them at your will as long as you maintain the format and semantics of the
    files. Additionally, there are various Perl scripts to help you generate the
    files, as it can be very tedious to do it by hand.

    The format and semantics of each of the files are very straightforward to
    understand and follow, so you should not have any issues during the first
    and second step.

2.  You would continue by tuning or setting the 'evolutionary parameters'
    of the genetic algorithm by means of the file '../data/evolution.config'.
    Again, the format and semantics are pretty similar to those of the files
    in step 1.

    These parameters are key in guiding the execution of the algorithm, since
    different configurations will lead to different ways of exploring the space
    of solutions for the problem that we will later select.

    It is also important to mention that, during the adjustments, you should
    bear in mind what problem you want to test and what are its characteristics,
    as these will ultimately decide which parameters' values are more
    appropriate regarding execution performance. For instance, there may be
    certain problems for which having a high probability of mutation could
    contribute more than a low one to finding high quality solutions.

3.  Once you have configured the evolution and the problem, now you would
    proceed to compile or install darwin. Although, you do not need to do these
    first three steps in order, it is recommended. The reason behind is that one
    of the steps during compilation/installation involves passing specific
    compiler flags that will cause darwin to be compiled for a particular
    problem set.

    For detailed instructions about installation see '../INSTALL'.

4.  You should already have the binary image 'darwin'. Now, you just have to
    invoke darwin with the appropriate commandline arguments: the paths for the
    evolution and problem configuration files we saw previously, and the path to
    the directory where you want to output the result.

        $ ./darwin  file/path/to/evolution.config
                    file/path/to/problem-instance.config
                    path/to/the/directory/where/you/want/the/results
