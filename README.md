This academic project aims to offer a comparative view, regarding performance, between two implementations of a simple Genetic Algorithm: one using a self-[adaptative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm#Adaptive_GAs) strategy
and one which does not. 

Given the complexity of the role that play [Evolution Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_strategy), as one of the subcategories of [Meta-heuristics](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Metaheuristic_Optimization), in Genetic Algorithms, the study here presented focuses on answering the following question: 

    how significant is the gain in performance that a Genetic Algorithm can achieve just by
    considering an adaptative mutation operator?
