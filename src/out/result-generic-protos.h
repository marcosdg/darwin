/*
    The X-Macro header of 'result.h' and the counterpart of
    'result-generic-defs.h'.

    This is part of a mechanism implemented via the C preprocessor to allow us to
    write 'generic' code via C macros.

    The job of this header is to store all the macro invocations of the macros
    defined in 'result.h', which in turn DECLARE all the prototypes of the
    'generic' functions later defined in 'result.c'. The appropriate macro
    invocation will be selected at compilation time by the user via the compiler
    option 'CPPFLAGS'.
