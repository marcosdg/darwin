    The X-Macro header of 'darwin.c'.

    This is part of a mechanism implemented via the C preprocessor to allow us to
    write 'generic' code via C macros.

    The job of this header is to store all the macro invocations of the macros
    defined in 'darwin.c', which in turn DEFINE all the 'generic' functions. The
    appropriate macro invocation will be selected at compilation time by the user
    via the compiler option 'CPPFLAGS'.
