# Darwin configuration file
# Genetic algorithm settings
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file defines some characteristics of genetic algorithm's behaviour
# implemented by darwin. Its modification impacts the time and space resources
# consumed, as well as the quality of the solution (or solutions) found.
#
# The available setting options are the following:
#
#   1. Maximum number of generations
#          Argument:
#               A positive integer greater than 0.
#       Description:
#               Total number of 'evolutive cycles' executed. An evolutive cycle
#               can be understood as a single execution of the basic genetic
#               operators (selection, cross-over, mutation and replacement) on
#               the population.
#
#   2. Population size
#          Argument:
#               A positive integer greater than 0.
#       Description:
#               Number of individuals (candidate solutions) throughout the entire
#               execution of the genetic algorithm.
#
#   3. Tournament size
#          Argument:
#               A positive integer greater than 0.
#       Description:
#               For the selection strategy, it represents the number of 'rivals'
#               that the 'aspirant' has to combat. It is equivalent to the number
#               of rounds of the tournament, since the number of rivals per round
#               is equal to 1.
#
#   4. Mutation probability
#          Argument:
#               -1 or any real number in the range [0, 1].
#       Description:
#               It can be either the adaptative mutation probability function
#               (-1) implemented by darwin, or a constant mutation probability
#               (argument: [0, 1]).
