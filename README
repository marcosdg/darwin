This directory tree holds version 1.0.0 of darwin, a simple genetic algorithm
implementation with an adaptative strategy.

The file INSTALL in this directory says how to build and install darwin on
various systems, once you unpacked (or git-cloned) the entire darwin file tree.

See the file COPYING for information about how to copy and distribute darwin.

The 'doc' subdirectory contains darwin specific documentation, including how to
use it and extend it.

The shell script 'autogen.sh' generates the file 'configure' (see below) and
other configuration files by executing the GNU build tools autoconf and
automake, which in turn use GNU m4 and Perl.

The shell script 'configure' (generated by 'autogen.sh') accomodates darwin to
your processor and operating system characteristics. It produces, as a result of
its execution, the file 'Makefile' (a script for the 'make' program), which
automates the process of building and installing darwin. See INSTALL for further
information.

The file 'configure.ac' is used by autoconf to create the 'configure' script.

The file 'Makefile.am' is used by automake to create the 'Makefile' script.

There are several other subdirectories:

'src'       holds the C language code for darwin

'data'      holds darwin input data and some auxiliary script files to
            facilitate and automate its generation. The data represents
            different instances of well-known NP problems that helps us testing
            the performance of darwin.

You may encounter bugs in this release. If you do, please report them; your bug
reports are valuable contributions to make darwin a better tool. Please, send
