'autoreconf' command (version 2.68) contains a BUG related to the "m4 subdir
convention" when executing 'autoreconf -i' with an empty m4 directory. The 
solution is adding a dummy file.

At the moment, the darwin project does not use m4 macros. This file exists for
mere informative purposes and solving the issue above mentioned.
